# Final-Project

The basics of the program is working, which is for it to: 
1. Open the map of the Dominican Republic in a window using the turle module.
2. Open a window prompting the user to "Name one province".
3. Everytime the user guesses a province correctly the counter goes up in the header of that window and the name of the province shows up in the map.

Things to work on at the moment:
At the moment, the names aren't showing in the right place, so I'm trying to figure out the coordenates part as I used https://www.mobilefish.com/php/record_mouse_coordinates/record_mouse_coordinates_upload.php and it wasn't quite right as I believe it just uses a x,y graph like Math. 
Noticed that it's CAP sensitive. Will make it not cap sensitive. 
The wrong guesses aren't being stored correctly. 

This is just the beginning of the project as I am thinking about creating a menu for the user to choose from a list of countries for them to play the guessing game. Once the first country works as intended I can add the rest of them using functions.
